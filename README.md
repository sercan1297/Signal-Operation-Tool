# Signal Processing Application

**Signal Processing Application** is an educational Python tool designed to help users create, visualize, and manipulate continuous and discrete time signals through an intuitive Tkinter-based GUI. The application supports generating elementary signals, performing operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and convolution, and displaying the results with integrated Matplotlib plots. Ideal for students, it offers a hands-on approach to understanding fundamental concepts in signal processing.

## Features

- **Elementary Signals:** Generate basic signals like sine, cosine, exponential, delta, square wave, triangle wave, and more.
- **Signal Operations:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and convolution on selected signals.
- **Visualization:** Interactive plots using Matplotlib to visualize input signals and operation results.
- **Discrete and Continuous Modes:** Switch between discrete time (n) and continuous time (t) for signal processing.
- **Shift Operations:** Adjust the position of input signals horizontally using shift sliders.
- **Convolution Animation:** Visualize the convolution process step-by-step with an interactive slider.
